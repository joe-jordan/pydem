Other python modules required to make this one work:

cjson - faster json decoding, with significantly less RAM usage than python's built in json support. Essential when working with large json files.
        available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cjson 

pygame - optional addition for simple 2D visualisations - pretty useful for debugging physics issues.
         available at http://www.pygame.org/


Not a python module, but still required!

lammps - the DEM engine that this project is built to use.
