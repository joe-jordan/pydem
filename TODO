debug simulations at low collision_time_ratio s (30 seemed to have errors, 100 less so. also appeared to be a dependence on frame rate -> number of simulation steps run at a time, which shouldn't matter if our assumptions are valid!)

implementation of binaries for running simulations and/or generating packs.

update to use newer lammps python build system released summer 2012.
